# Covid-19-simulation
The project involves simulation of a population for 100 days, and their chances of infecting a neighbour should they test positive for covid-19. 

The project tracks the number of individuals who are infected and their current state - sick, dead etc as well as their spread probability for contact tracing amongst the neighbours in the community.

Detailed comments are added to the source code for easy understanding. The simulation works by running the "main.cpp" file which uses data about the population and respective neighbours for the covid simulation.
